        <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of AI is Machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.
        </p>
        <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS </h3>
        <P>
            listed herewith below are some of the major AI takeawats.

            <li>
                Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human like.

            UNDERSTANDING AI.
        </h3>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of AI include mimicking human cognitive activities. Researchers and developers in the  field are making surprising rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning and perception to the extent that these can be concretely defined. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgements that are subject to human experience.

                    IMPORTANCE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
                </h3>

                                <strong>Automates repetitive learning and discovery through data:</strong> Instead of automating manual tasks, AI performs frequent, high-volume, computerized tasks. And it does so reliably and without fatigue of course, humans are still essential to set up the system and ask the right question
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               <strong>AI adds intelligence to existing products:</strong> Many products you already use will be improved with AI capabilities.Automation, conversational platforms, bots and smart machines can be combined with large amounts of data to improve many technologies. Upgrades at home and in the workplace, range from security intelligence and smart cams to investment analysis.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               <strong>AI analyzes more and deeper data </strong>using neural networks that have many hidden layers. Building a fraud detection system with hidden layers used to be impossible. All that has changed with incredible computer power and big data. You need lots of data to train deep learning models because they learn directly from the data.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               <strong>AI adapts through progressive learning algorithms</strong> to let the data do the programming. AI finds structure and regularities in data so that algorithms can acquire skills. Ust as an algorithm can teach itself to play chess, it can teach itself what product to recommend next online. And the models adapt when given new data.

            <h3>FAQ on Artificial Intelligence</h3>

            <ol>
                <li> 
                    <h4>Will AI steal your jobs?</h4>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence is the fastest-growing field in the present-day. Artificial Intelligence is regarded as the “Hottest” job of the present generation.The demand for skilled AI specialists is growing faster like never before. Requirements and open positions for experts in the subfields of AI like machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, statistics, and natural language processing are surging each day.
                    The question that arises naturally is will AI become that powerful eventually that it has the capacity to steal all our jobs?This statement that AI will steal your jobs in the future can almost be considered a myth, in my opinion. It is a hypothetical scenario where Artificial Intelligence will replace all human activities and take over a majority of the tasks of the modern world because they are less prone to human error and perform the particular task more efficiently.
                    Similar things were stated during the times of the industrial revolution when machines were introduced. Obviously, it did not steal job opportunities. Instead, it paved the way for more jobs for humans to control them. Humans are intellectual beings. Hence, AI will simplify the complexity of human work but won’t actually take away your jobs!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <h4>Can AI take over the world?</h4>
                    <p>Science fiction (Sci-fi) movies have changed some people’s perception of Artificial Intelligence. They image robots programmed with AI will become so powerful that they will eventually destroy their creator and destroy the entire world leading to the development of a new AI-controlled species.
                    It is undeniable that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way and developed into a unique feature of the modern world. Despite the advancements in AI, most of the tasks are still done under some kind of human supervision in the working or the development stages.
                    Artificial Intelligence is also limited to be the particular task that it is programmed to complete. An interesting example is self-driving cars, where AI takes control of the car and drives it to the desired destination of the user’s choice. However, the AI is only limited to the driving of the car precisely and no other external tasks.
                    So, for AI take over the world as shown in the sci-fi movies, we are still at least a few decades away from such an outcome. But, just to keep the curiosity around this speculation, it could eventually be possible in the future! Although currently, this is only fiction.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <h4>What are the pros of AI?</h4>
                    <p>Since the hype generated for Artificial Intelligence in the modern era is humungous, it has a wide array of merits.Apart from the previously discussed massive job opportunities created by AI, it also has other pros, such as the completion of looping or repetitive tasks that humans need to perform without the disadvantage of a human-prone error.
                    Artificial Intelligence, similar to a computer program, cannot tire and hence has the capacity to work all day long on a particular task until the desired results are accomplished.They have the ability to perform faster computations compared to human speed on a wide range of problems with precise results. They also have tons of real-life applications to make our daily lives simpler. The pros of Artificial Intelligence are self-explanatory and limitless.

                <li>
                    <h4>What are the cons of AI?</h4>
                   <p>The construction of Artificial Intelligence models from scratch can sometimes be time-consuming and resourcefully exhaustive. If you are looking to develop a deep learning model on a normal computer without a GPU, your alternative would be to switch to a cloud platform because the building procedure of the model is not sustainable on your PC.Apart from consuming a lot of time and resources, the deployment of Artificial Intelligence models can also be quite expensive in some cases. Also, the maintenance costs in case of malfunctioning of the AI models in peculiar cases can be annoying to deal with and solve.
                    Another significant demerit of Artificial Intelligence to consider is the lack of the use of Artificial General Intelligence to accomplish more superior and intellectual tasks. We are limited to Artificial Narrow Intelligence. ANI is beneficial and essential for performing numerous tasks, but it is not quite effective as AGI. This point leads us to our next question.
