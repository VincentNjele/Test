                <h1>Software Development</h1>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        People both inside and outside IT often ask what software development is. It is a process to create computer software using one or more specific programming languages that provides functionality to address particular business or personal objectives.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software. The development of software is usually a planned initiative with a number of steps and stages that result in the creation of operational software. Hence a good definition is: “a process with a set of activities that create computer software products, including their design, development, testing, and deployment.” 
                        Software itself is a set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable.
                        Software development provides a series of steps for programmers to create computer programs. This process makes up the phases in the software development life cycle. Understanding the software development method offers vast opportunities in the IT industry.

                        <br>
                        There are three basic types:
                        <ol>
                            <li>System software: provides core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.</li>
                            <li>Programming software: gives programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code.</li>
                            <li>Application software: (applications or apps) helps users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media players and security programs are examples. Applications also refers to web and mobile applications like those used to shop on Amazon.com, socialize with Facebook or post pictures to Instagram.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <br>
                            A possible fourth type is embedded software. Embedded systems software is used to control machines and devices not typically considered computers — telecommunications networks, cars, industrial robots and more. These devices, and their software, can be connected as part of the Internet of Things (IoT)
                            Software development is primarily conducted by programmers, software engineers and software developers. These roles interact and overlap, and the dynamics between them vary greatly across development departments and communities.
                            A Person who engages in such a journey is referred to as a Software Developer.

                <h2>
                    Courses and Skills Required To Be Software Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to thrive well in Software Development one has to have an understanding of a few basic skills or concepts, among them are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Coding and computer programming <br>
                            Even if it’s rare for Software Developers to spend their days writing code, it’s a must for a variety of reasons for a good Software Developer to be familiar with all of the same programming languages that a Web Developer would know, including Python, Java, C/C++ and Ruby, as well as other programming fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms.
                            Even someone with a computer science degree but without significant programming experience would be encouraged to attend a coding bootcamp if they were looking to become a Software Developer.
                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Software testing <br>
                            Even in the age of automation, understanding the ins and outs of software testing and debugging is one of the core technical skills required if you want to become a Software Developer.
                            Though new AI programs can perform some of these tasks, testing is still a costly and time-consuming part of any software development project so becoming adept at performing these tasks is valuable to a Software Developer. The testing process also relies on one of a Software Developer’s soft skills: problem solving.
                            
                        </li>
                        <li>Object-oriented design (OOD) <br>
                            An approach to software design that has continually gained in popularity over the last few decades, OOD is defined by key principles including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, decomposition, and generalization. In simpler terms, it’s worth it for a Software Developer to understand how to apply object-oriented design guidelines to create flexible, modular and reusable software
                            In addition to these skills, some soft skills are also highly needed, which some of them includes: 
                            <br>
                            
                            Good Communication skills: Software Developers should be able to clearly communicate – in writing and orally – with virtually any type of team or company stakeholder, regardless of that person’s technical background. ability to be a team Player, 
                            Problem solving and readiness to pay attention to details.
