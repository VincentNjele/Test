                In the world of medicine, its not possible to become a neurosurgeon or a cardiologist overnight
                but requires foundation training in medicine(MBBS) followed by further specialization in medicine 
                or surgery before going for super specialization. Likewise, the world of information technology (IT) 
                has become a field of specialists, just as in medicine; the progression in the career would depend 
                on how much more specialized study you have done after the foundation training in computer science 
                or computer engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                Information security (sometimes referred to as InfoSec) is a career path that covers the tools and 
                processes that organizations use to protect information, policies and procedures that prevent 
                unauthorized people from accessing business or personal information, threats, vulnerability 
                management and the defenses that can be devised to prevent sabotaging of information. 
                In as much we can talk about information security,there exists a career similar to Information 
                security, called  cybersecurity, these two paths are different in both scope and purpose. 
                The two terms are often used interchangeably, but more accurately, cybersecurity is a subcategory 
                of information security. Information security is a broad field that covers many areas such as 
                physical security, endpoint security,Cryptography, Mobile Computing, Cyber Forensics and network 
                security. While the 
                later addresses technology-related threats, with practices and tools that can prevent or mitigate them.
            </p>
            <p>
                InfoSec is a growing and evolving field that covers a wide range of fields, from network and infrastructure
                security to testing and auditing, responsibilities and basic tools for information security and the levels 
                of training and expertise needed 
                in organizations to reach and maintain a state of acceptable security. It covers concepts and applications of 
                system and data security.
                Firstly it is important to understand information, primarily information from a security perspective 
                is described as a strategic resource upon which a successful organization depends. On the other hand 
                Security is the unification of the three facets namely, Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability 
                commonly called the “CIA” triad. Consider the diagram depicting the triad.

                    A huge number of IoT devices make their security a high priority and are important for the future 
                    well-being of the internet ecosystem. By learning this skill, 
                    you will be able to explore current security and privacy-related concerns in the IoT domain
                </li>
                <li>
                    Communication Skills: As a security expert, you will be working closely with different teams and 
                    departments. It is important to be able to communicate effectively to explain your issues, 
                    concerns, and solutions to others. You should be able to convey even 
                    the most technical information to individuals of different levels in a comprehensible manner.

            <h3>FAQ about information security</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b> What is Information Security ?</b><br>
                        Is the protection of information and its critical elements, including the systems and hardware that use, store, and transmit the organizational information. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>What Are The Components Of An Information System?</b><br>
                        An Information System (IS) is much more than computer hardware; it is  the entire set of software, hardware, data, people, and procedures necessary to use information as a resource in the organization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Isn't information security an IT issue?</b><br>
                        Information security is an organizational issue, not exclusively an IT issue. 
                        IT provides security to central systems and the University network. However, 
                        much of the risk to IT resources can only be managed within units' day-to-day 
                        operations. We all share responsibility for properly managing the University's 
                        IT resources, including University information and IT devices.
                        Units have significant autonomy to fulfill their operational missions. Each unit
                         has a 
                        responsibility to manage its own security posture just like each individual has a 
                        responsibility for his or her own actions. 
                        Security is a balance between the need for information security and the need for information use.
