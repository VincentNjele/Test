                    <p>
                        So you’re interested in a graphic design career? Then you’re in luck: you’ve chosen a profession where there’s strong demand from employers right now, and where the salaries are pretty impressive, even for starting positions.

                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        And let’s face it, it’s one of the coolest professions around. You’re going to be waking up every morning knowing you’ll spend the day doing something you love, alongside fellow creatives who share your passion and keep you inspired. Some careers have your progression mapped out before you even start (how depressing is that?), but being a designer leads you to jobs, companies and places you never expected. With graphic design, you’ll have a myriad of options open to you, including—in a time of rapid technical innovation—some that haven’t even been invented yet. In short, graphic design is one of the best careers you can choose to pursue.


                    </p>
                     
                    <p>
                        Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users’ specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, to optimize the user experience.

                    <h3>4 reasons it’s a good idea to pursue a graphic design career

                    </h3>
                    <h4>1.Design will always be in demand:
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        In the age of automation, when we’re constantly being told that our jobs will one day be taken over by robots, you can be rest assured that graphic design will always require human thinking and creativity. It’s an essential cog in the world of work; one that is required for any brand or business.
                        While simple design collateral could be automated, it takes a graphic designer to develop holistic brands and clever communication that will be unique and appeal to the target audience. This makes a career in graphic design a smart, future-proof decision.
                        
                        
                    </p><br>

                    <h4>2.Design opens up so many different career paths
                    </h4>
                    
                    <p>

                       You’ll be able to add value to any workplace, not just a design studio. Design is something that no business can live without.
                       If an agency isn’t quite for you, perhaps you might want to venture into editorial design and work for a major publisher? Or join an internal team at one of the world’s biggest sports brands? Your graphic design career path is open to so many exciting routes.


                    </p>

                    <h4>3.Designing will boost your problem-solving skills

                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Creativity is crucial for any business. Steve Jobs of Apple once said: “It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough. It’s technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing.”
                        It’s for this reason that a graphic design career will enhance your problem-solving skills—not just because you’re overcoming common issues for clients; but because you’re encouraged to consider the bigger picture. What will your design solve? How will it add value? How will it achieve a brand’s goals? Design will boost more skills than you realize.

                    </p>

                    <h4>4.Your graphic design career path is unpredictable
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Think you’re just going to follow the herd? A graphic design career can take you to places you never thought possible. You could secure a job at a studio on the other side of the planet, or find that your employment means lots of travel to far flung places. You might even go solo and launch your own studio someday. The possibilities really are endless.

                      Although the visual element of design is the main reason many people choose to study graphics, some prefer to explore more of the behind-the-scenes ‘process’ when entering the industry. UX and UI provide fantastic graphic design careers to the technically skilled, utilizing designers’ abilities to help users to easily interact with a product.

                            Cemented in the heritage of graphic design, letterpress printing is likely to be on the list of dream careers for many. However, being a highly skilled practice, it takes years of work to develop the trade. Shillington graduate Eleanor Rogers worked as an administrative assistant in corporate finance before deciding to kickstart her graphic design career. After graduation, she landed an amazing opportunity at Chapel Press, a specialist letterpress print studio in Melbourne, and has enjoyed her unique role since.

But graphic design isn't just about business and progression, it's an art form and it allows people to express themselves as well.

                                The most difficult type of software and programming languages to learn are those that are very specialist and esoteric, designed for specific types of hardware such as device controllers.
