        <h1>DATA SCIENCE</h1>
        <h2>About This Course:</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. 
                The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they 
                accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working 
                in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do. This field 
                is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get
                 an overview of what data science is today.
            </p>
            <h2>What is DATA SCIENCE today?</h2>
            <p>
                Data sciences is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms 
                and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data,and 
                apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains.
                 Data science is related to data mining,machine learning and big data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data science is a "concept to unify statistics,data analysis,informatics, and their related methods
                " in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.It uses techniques and theories 
                drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,statistics,computer science,information 
                science, and domain knowledge.However, data science is different from computer science and 
                information science.Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" 
                of science (empirical,theoretical,computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything 
                about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.A data
                 scientist is someone who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create
                  insights from data
            </p>
            <h2>How data science is transforming business
            </h2>
            <P>
                Organizations are using data science to turn data into a competitive advantage by refining products and services.
                 Data science and machine learning use cases include:

                    Improve sales by creating recommendations for customers based upon previous purchases
                    Many companies have made data science a priority and are investing in it heavily. In Gartner’s recent survey of more than 3,000 CIOs, respondents ranked analytics and business intelligence as the top differentiating technology for their organizations. The CIOs surveyed see these technologies as the most strategic for their companies, and are investing accordingly.

            <h2>
                How data science is conducted
            </h2>      
            <p>
                The process of analyzing and acting upon data is iterative rather than linear, but this is how the data science lifecycle typically flows for a data modeling project:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Planning:</b> Define a project and its potential outputs.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                <b>Building a data model:</b>Data scientists often use a variety of open source libraries or in-database tools to build machine learning models. Often, users will want APIs to help with data ingestion, data profiling and visualization, or feature engineering. They will need the 
                right tools as well as access to the right data and other resources, such as compute power.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Evaluating a model:</b> Data scientists must achieve a high percent of accuracy for their models before they can feel confident deploying it. Model evaluation will typically generate a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics and visualizations to measure model performance against new data, and also rank them over time to enable optimal behavior in production. Model evaluation goes beyond raw performance to take into account expected baseline behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Explaining models:</b>Being able to explain the internal mechanics of the results of machine learning models in human terms has not always been possible—but it is becoming increasingly important. Data scientists want automated explanations of the relative weighting and importance of factors that go into generating a prediction, and model-specific explanatory details on model predictions.
            </p>
    
            <p><b>Deploying a model:</b> Taking a trained, machine learning model and getting it into the right systems is often a difficult and laborious process. This can be made easier by operationalizing models as scalable and secure APIs, or by using in-database machine learning models.
            </p>
            <p><b>Monitoring models:</b> Unfortunately, deploying a model isn’t the end of it. Models must always be monitored after deployment to ensure that they are working properly. The data the model was trained on may no longer be relevant for future predictions after a period of time. For example, in fraud detection, criminals are always coming up with new ways to hack accounts.
