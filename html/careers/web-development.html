        <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p>
            No matter what’s going on in the world around us, technology is omnipresent in our lives. Whether it’s
            scrolling through our favorite social media apps, checking the news, paying for something online, or
            connecting with colleagues using collaboration software and tools—most of what we do relies on some form of
            technology. Behind this technology is a team of web developers who have not only built it, but constantly
            maintain it to ensure it works flawlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
            intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
            text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
            Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and
            programming that powers the website’s functionality.

        </p>
        <h3>TYPES OF WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <P>
            Web Development can be classified into 3 types: Front-end, Back-end and Full stack.
        </P>
        <ol>
            <li>

                <h3> Front-end web development:</h3> This is the Client-side of a website. It is responsible for the
                look and feel
                of a website. This means how colors, type, icons, and images appear. Increasingly, front-end development
                has to account for how a website looks on all devices, from desktop to tablet to phone.
                Typical programming languages include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
                Front-end developers keep up with cutting-edge trends in web design and development to make sure
                websites are optimized for users and search engines and with security best practices in mind.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Back-end web development:</h3> This is the Server-side of a website. It is responsible for building
                and
                maintaining the code that runs a website. This code connects the website to the server and ensures that
                data flows properly to the website and that transactions are processed correctly. Typical programming
                languages include Java , PHP, and MySQL; newer tools include Python and Golang.
                Back-end web developers can keep up with changes in technology by participating in networking
                communities that share coding tips and support.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Full-stack web development:</h3> This covers both front-end and back-end responsibilities. Depending
                on the
                complexity of a website, a full-stack developer may be responsible for all facets of its development,
                from the server side to the user interface. Many full-stack developers may still specialize in one
                aspect of web development, but their broad experience is useful in troubleshooting or speeding up a
                build or redesign.
                Full-stack developers are often responsible for identifying cutting-edge technologies, such as enhanced
                programming languages (or even no- or low-code trends) and blockchain, that can be used to strengthen
                websites’ business capabilities.

        <h3>
            Required Skills to become a successful Web Developer
        </h3>
        <p>
            The following are just a few of the skills that can help professionals advance their careers in web
            development.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Programming abilities: Strong coding skills are essential. Mastering programming languages such as HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript is just a start. Technology changes fast, so a willingness to always be learning new 
                coding techniques is important.
            </li>
            <li>
                Attention to detail: Testing and debugging code requires patience and analytical skills to understand
                what went wrong and how to fix it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Creative thinking: Successful websites have to attract and keep users, as well as be visible to search
                engines. Web developers have to be creative in how they pull together user experience, search engine
                optimization, and other factors in building a good site.
            </li>
            While many web designers work alone, most work for an organization. Understanding the needs of the sales
            department, for example, is crucial in creating a successful website. Collaborating with user experience or
            content creation experts is also a necessary skill.
            Web developers can rely on a variety of community resources for everything from finding a job to helping
            with tough coding problems. Web experts advise new developers to become part of these communities.
