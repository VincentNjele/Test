                        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet 
                        (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range 
                        from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, 
                        electronic businesses, and social network services. Web development is not 
                        concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding 
                        and programming that powers the website’s functionality.

                        Software development refers to a discipline of computer science comprising of activities dedicated to 
                        the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software. 
                        The development of software is usually a planned initiative with a number of 
                        steps and stages that result in the creation of operational software. 
                        Hence a good definition is: “a process with a set of activities that create 
                        computer software products, including their design, development, testing, and 
                        deployment.”

                        Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. 
                        By applying visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures
                         to meet users’ specific needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive 
                         designs, to optimize the user experience.
